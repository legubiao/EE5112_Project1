\section{Task 0. Recognize Facial Expressions}
In this task, we built a linear logistic regression classification model, and used this model to predict the test set.
Here are some key parts of the code. As requirement, we defined the Logistic Regression model with solver='sag':
\begin{python}
model = linear_model.LogisticRegression(solver='sag')
model.fit(x, y)
y_test_pred = model.predict(np.vstack(dfTest['pixels'].values))
\end{python}
After training finished, there will have a warning:
\begin{python}
ConvergenceWarning: The max_iter was reached which means the coef_ did not converge
\end{python}
This is because that
